# Database Overview

The following tables are grouped by functional domain. Refer to
`docs/database-schema.sql` for the detailed DDL.

| Domain | Tables | Notes |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| **Authentication & Identity** | `users`, `roles`, `user_roles` | Central identity store with role assignments. |

| **Shipping & Logistics** | `shipments`, `shipment_events` | Manifests generated by admin, claimed by shipper, with tracking updates. |
| **Reviews & Feedback** | `reviews` | Customer reviews with media attachments. |

## Key Data Types

| Column Type | Usage |
| ----------- | ----- |
| `BINARY(16)` | UUID primary/foreign keys for most entities. |
| `VARCHAR(191)` | Unique string keys/URLs safe for MySQL utf8mb4 indexes. |
| `ENUM` | Controlled status fields (user status, order status, etc.). |
| `JSON` | Flexible structures: addresses, option values, payloads. |
| `DATETIME` | Timestamp columns with automatic updates (`created_at`, `updated_at`). |
| `DECIMAL(12,2)` | Currency fields (price, totals, COD). |
| `TINYINT(1)` | Boolean flags such as `is_active`, `is_read`, `is_primary`. |

This design supports the admin workflows (user/seller governance and shipment creation) while remaining extensible for future analytics, reporting, and integrations.
